Self-Organizing Mesh Network 

The SOMN protocol implements a two-layered network protocol for communication between distributed low-memory-footprint peers in a mesh network.  The top layer (the Communication Layer) allows a peer to send an arbitrary data stream up to a fixed length defined by the implementation.  The lower layer (the Mesh Layer) allows a peer to discover a route to any other peer in the mesh and route messages to that peer.
